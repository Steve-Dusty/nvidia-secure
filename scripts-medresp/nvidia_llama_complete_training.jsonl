Fentanyl Supply Changes (2023 Spike Explanation):**\n- 2023: Novel fentanyl analogs entered supply → higher potency, more doses to reverse\n- Naloxone effectiveness per overdose decreased temporarily\n- This explains why high distribution (139,828) didn't prevent spike\n\n**2.

COVID-19 Social Isolation (2021 Baseline):**\n- 2021 had elevated baseline (641 deaths) due to isolation → more solo drug use\n- Solo use = fewer witnesses to administer naloxone\n- 2021 naloxone effectiveness may be artificially low\n\n**4.

Sustainability (Months 19-24)**\n- Maintain intervention in all districts\n- Monitor long-term effects\n- Assess whether effects persist or diminish (saturation point?)\n\n---\n\n**DATA COLLECTION:**\n\n**Primary Outcome:**\n- Overdose deaths per district per month (medical examiner, death certificates)\n\n**Secondary Outcomes:**\n- Non-fatal overdoses (911 call data + EMS reports)\n- Naloxone administrations (peer navigators report, EMS reports)\n- Overdose-to-death ratio (lower ratio = more reversals)\n\n**Confound Control Variables:**\n1. **MAT enrollment:** Weekly counts per district (expect no change if designed correctly)\n2. **Drug supply:** Monthly fentanyl concentration testing (20 samples/district)\n3. **Economic:** Unemployment rate, housing instability metrics\n4. **Demographics:** Age, race/ethnicity of overdose decedents (check for differential effects)\n5. **Seasonality:** Month fixed effects in statistical model\n\n---\n\n**STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:**\n\n**Model: Segmented Regression for ITS**\n\nOutcome = β₀ + β₁(time) + β₂(intervention) + β₃(time_since_intervention) + β₄(MAT_enrollment) + β₅(fentanyl_concentration) + β₆(unemployment) + ε\n\nWhere:\n- **time**: Months from study start (controls for underlying trend)\n- **intervention**: Binary (0 before intervention, 1 after)\n- **time_since_intervention**: Months since district received intervention (tests for dose-response)\n- **Covariates**: MAT, drug supply, economic factors\n\n**Causal Inference Criteria:**\n1. **Immediate level change**: β₂ significant (deaths drop when intervention starts)\n2. **Slope change**: β₃ significant (deaths decline accelerates post-intervention)\n3. **No pre-intervention trend**: β₁ near zero (parallel trends assumption)\n4. **Consistency across districts**: Stratified analysis shows similar β₂ and β₃\n\n**Sensitivity Analyses:**\n- Exclude 2023 spike period (test if finding robust to outlier year)\n- Vary lag time (test if effect appears immediately vs 1-3 month delay)\n- Placebo test: Apply model to pre-intervention data (should show no effect)\n\n---\n\n**EXPECTED RESULTS (Hypothetical):**\n\n**If Naloxone is Causally Effective:**\n- **Immediate effect (β₂):** -12% deaths in month intervention starts (95% CI: -18% to -6%)\n- **Sustained effect (β₃):** Additional -2% per month for 6 months, then plateaus\n- **Cumulative 6-month effect:** -23% deaths (95% CI: -30% to -16%)\n- **Non-fatal overdoses:** Increase by 8-12% (more reversals = more survived overdoses reported)\n- **Heterogeneity:** Larger effects in districts with higher baseline peer network density\n\n**If Confounded by MAT:**\n- MAT enrollment coefficient (β₄) explains majority of variance\n- Naloxone β₂ and β₃ become non-significant when MAT controlled\n- Interpretation: MAT is primary driver, naloxone is secondary\n\n**If No Causal Effect (Spurious Correlation):**\n- β₂ and β₃ non-significant\n- Temporal trends (β₁) explain death fluctuations\n- Conclusion: Correlation was due to time-varying confounds, not naloxone\n\n---\n\n**POWER ANALYSIS:**\n\n**Sample size:** 11 districts × 24 months = 264 district-months\n- Expected deaths per district-month: 4.8 (based on 635 annual deaths / 11 districts / 12 months)\n- **Power to detect 15% reduction:** 92% (α=0.05, two-tailed)\n- **Minimum detectable effect:** 11% reduction\n\n**Challenges:**\n- Small number of clusters (11 districts) limits statistical power\n- Mitigation: Use weekly rather than monthly data (×4 observations)\n\n---\n\n**BUDGET & TIMELINE:**\n\n**Costs:**\n- Naloxone procurement: 105,600 units × $3 = $316,800\n- Peer navigator training & stipends: $450,000\n- Automated vending machines: 22 units × $15,000 = $330,000\n- Data collection & analysis: $180,000 (1.5 FTE researchers × 24 months)\n- **Total: $1,276,800**\n\n**Timeline:** 30 months (6 baseline + 18 rollout + 6 sustainability)\n\n---\n\n**PUBLICATION & POLICY IMPACT:**\n\n**If Positive Results:**\n- Target journals: *JAMA*, *New England Journal of Medicine*, *Lancet Public Health*\n- Policy recommendations:\n  * Federal funding for naloxone distribution: $500M annually\n  * Insurance coverage mandates for naloxone (no cost-sharing)\n  * Good Samaritan law expansions (protect naloxone administrators)\n\n**If Null Results:**\n- Refocus resources on MAT expansion (higher ROI)\n- Investigate naloxone distribution efficiency (access vs utilization gap)\n- Test alternative interventions (safe consumption sites, drug checking)\n\n**Estimated Lives Saved (If Causal Effect Proven):**\n- SF alone: 120-150 deaths/year prevented with optimized distribution\n- National scale-up: 15,000-20,000 deaths/year prevented across U.S."}
